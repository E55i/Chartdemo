# Demonstration of react-chartjs-2

This project demonstrates how to use [react-chartjs-2](https://react-chartjs-2.js.org/), which provides react components for the [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) library. The project is based on the [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).

There are two demonstrations in this project. First demo is how to draw a basic line chart with linear axis. For the first demo the data is loaded from the file src/data/Co2-demo.json and then directly imported in the src/App.js file. Second demo is a line chart with time axis and using the luxon date adapter. More information about the axis types:

* Axis types available in Chart.js [https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/axes/cartesian/](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/axes/cartesian/).
* Luxon date adapter [https://github.com/chartjs/chartjs-adapter-luxon](https://github.com/chartjs/chartjs-adapter-luxon).
